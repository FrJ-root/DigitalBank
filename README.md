# Java Digital Banking Console Application

## üìã Project Overview

A Java console application for digital banking that allows users to create, manage, and view bank accounts, as well as perform common banking operations. This project serves as a foundation for Java learners to practice object-oriented programming, business rule implementation, and financial data handling.

## üéØ Educational Objectives

- Implement object-oriented programming (entities, services, repositories, separation of concerns)
- Properly handle financial amounts using BigDecimal (precision, 2 decimal places)
- Implement basic authentication (email + password) and session management
- Apply banking business rules (balances, transfers, account closure)
- Produce structured, readable, and testable code

## üîë Key Features

### Authentication & Profile Management
- **Registration**: Create an account with full name, email (unique), address, and password (min 6 characters)
- **Login**: Access the system using email and password
- **Session Management**: Authenticated users can access their resources; logout functionality
- **Profile Updates**: Modify email and/or address information
- **Password Changes**: Update password (minimum 6 characters)

### Bank Account Management
- **Account Creation**: Generate unique readable IDs (e.g., BK-XXXX-1234), with initial balance of 0 and active status
- **Account Listing**: Users can view only their own accounts
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check balance by account
- **Account Closure**: Only by the account owner and if the balance is 0; account status changed to inactive (no physical deletion)

### Transaction Processing
- **Deposits**: Increase balance; record a DEPOSIT transaction
- **Withdrawals**: Decrease balance if sufficient funds available; record a WITHDRAW transaction
- **Internal Transfers**:
  - Between existing accounts A ‚Üí B: Double entry ‚Äî TRANSFEROUT on A, TRANSFERIN on B
  - To unknown destination: Debit on A and TRANSFEROUT entry with counterparty (external ID); no internal credit
- **Transaction History**: Chronological sorting; detailed display (date/time, type, amount, description, potential counterparty)

### Console Interface
- Clear menus, explicit error messages, guided input
- Input validation: numeric values, amounts > 0, max 2 decimal places, non-empty email, password ‚â• 6 characters

## üìê Architecture

### Domain Model
- **User**: id: UUID, fullName: String, email: String, address: String
- **Account**: accountId: String, ownerUserId: UUID, balance: BigDecimal(2), createdAt: Instant, active: boolean
- **Transaction**: id: UUID, timestamp: Instant, accountId: String, type: {DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, TRANSFERIN, TRANSFEROUT}, amount: BigDecimal(2), counterpartyAccountId?: String, description?: String

### Software Components
- **Main (Console UI)**: Menus, inputs, displays, flow control
- **Services**:
  - AuthService: Registration, login, session, profile, password
  - AccountService: Creation, listing, closure, owner & balance checks
  - TransactionService: Deposit, withdrawal, transfer, history consultation
- **Repositories**:
  - Interfaces: UserRepository, AccountRepository, TransactionRepository
  - In-memory implementations: InMemoryUserRepository, InMemoryAccountRepository, InMemoryTransactionRepository
- **Utils**: Console input, amount parsing/validation

## üíº Business Rules

- **Currency**: BigDecimal scale = 2; amount > 0; ‚â§ 2 decimal places
- **Withdrawal/Transfer**: Rejected if insufficient balance
- **Closure**: Only by owner and if balance = 0
- **Ownership**: A user can only operate on their own accounts
- **Traceability**: Any operation modifies the balance and adds an immutable history line
- **Inactivity**: Any operation on an inactive account is rejected
- **Email uniqueness**: Registration fails if the email already exists

## üë§ User Flow

### Welcome Menu (Not Connected)
- Register
- Login
- Exit

### Main Menu (Connected as "[username]")
- Create account
- List my accounts
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Transfer
- Transaction history
- Update profile
- Change password
- Close account
- Logout
- Exit

## üß™ Test Data & Scenarios

### Test Users
- alice@example.com (pwd ‚â• 6)
- bob@example.com (pwd ‚â• 6)

### Test Scenarios
1. Alice creates accounts A1 & A2; deposits 500 on A1; transfers 200 from A1‚ÜíA2; withdraws 50 from A2
2. Bob creates account B1; attempts to withdraw 100 from a 0 balance ‚Üí fails; deposits 100; withdraws 80 ‚Üí succeeds
3. Closing account A2 if balance is 0; otherwise rejected

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Functional registration/login; email uniqueness checked
- Account creation/listing/viewing/closing compliant with rules
- Deposits/Withdrawals/Transfers: Correct balance updates + proper history recording
- History sorted by date with type, amount, description (and counterparty if transfer)
- Clear error messages (invalid amount, insufficient balance, inactive account, non-owner, etc.)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
